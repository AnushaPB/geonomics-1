- knock out these secondary to-do items

        5 decide what to do if someone instantiates a model that has no neutral loci (line 126 in genome.py currently throws an error)

        5 use Wright's genetic neighborhood/cruising distance to set window width of DensityGrids

        5 decide whether or not to enable non-moving populations! (right now it's offered in the params, but then doesn't work)
                IF SO, PROBABLY NEED TO CREATE A DISPERSAL SURFACE JUST LIKE THE MOVEMENT SURFACE

        5 add type annotation to all functions

        5 write lots of checks on the types of all the data in the params file, with informative errors

        2 finalize nice string representations for all classes

        2 generalize the change fns some more, so that landscape changes can also be made cyclical, random, etc (like pop-dem changes)

        1 write a function for plotting the community (where each pop has a different color) (how about some way for each population to have its fitness
          plotted with colors as usual, but SHAPE to be population indicator?)

        1 perhaps read through and consider rewriting mating.find_mates() (i.e. consider how to re-implement repro_age and sex to speed it up)

        5 debug all the various ways that pop extinction breaks the model; here is one example, that results from one of multiple populations going extinct
