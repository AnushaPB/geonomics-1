- knock out these secondary to-do items

        5 I think I should rename Land and Scape to Landscape and Layer respectively (pain in the ass, but that seems to map onto GIS/geographic terminology better,
          and can be shortened to the two nice acronyms 'scp' and 'lyr' for attributes, etc)        

        5 finish making all appropriate functions, methods, attributes, and classes private (by adding _ at front), while also reading through the code line by line
          - and do I need to make all the attributes of private classes (e.g. _DensityGridStack) also private?

        5 make all lines <= 80 length!

        3 write a Land.plot_land_changes method (akin to Population.plot_demographic_changes)??

        5 write `Model.plot` methods to wrap around all the pop and land plotting methods (where they just take a required first arg, either the pop number or name or the scape number or name

        5 pick through all the notes in demography.py and decide which are taken care of, which need to stay, which I still need to take care of, etc. 

        5 finish draft docs:
          - typing up the Data Structures and Operations sections of the draft docs.txt
          - toy around with Sphinx and ReST, to make sure that my docs work for that (or adjust formatting if not)
          - fix comments for all of the params file, then figure out best way to copy/paste the full params file into the docs draft
          - then added longer-form version where the comment next to each parameter is explained in detail
          - write docstrings for all the key classes
          - add the docstrings to the docs draft (maybe write a Py script to do this, so that I can rerun it to recompile the docs whenever the docstrings are updated?)
          - make some simple flow diagram for now

        3 make trait names also their dict-entry keys, rather than values inside their dicts (like pop and scape), then add the check of
          of trait-name uniqueness for each pop to gnx.read_params()

        5 decide what to do if someone instantiates a model that has no neutral loci (line 126 in genome.py currently throws an error)

        5 use Wright's genetic neighborhood/cruising distance to set window width of DensityGrids
                BUT: I can't exactly do this without working out the following issues:
                1. - If I try to use a window width that isn't a whole-number factor of the landscape
                     dimensions then I get weird errors in the calculated density surface (I have
                     images of this saved under 10-09-18 in the images directory on my Desktop)
                2. - The runtime get ridiculous at small window widths for large landscapes and large
                     numbers of individuals (see runtime plots, also in the same directory as above)

        5 decide whether or not to enable non-moving populations! (right now it's offered in the params, but then doesn't work)
                IF SO, PROBABLY NEED TO CREATE A DISPERSAL SURFACE JUST LIKE THE MOVEMENT SURFACE

        5 add type annotation to all functions

        5 write lots of checks on the types of all the data in the params file, with informative errors

        2 finalize nice string representations for all classes

        2 generalize the change fns some more, so that landscape changes can also be made cyclical, random, etc (like pop-dem changes)

        1 write a function for plotting the community (where each pop has a different color) (how about some way for each population to have its fitness
          plotted with colors as usual, but SHAPE to be population indicator?)

        1 perhaps read through and consider rewriting mating.find_mates() (i.e. consider how to re-implement repro_age and sex to speed it up)

        5 debug all the various ways that pop extinction breaks the model; here is one example, that results from one of multiple populations going extinct
