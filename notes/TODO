- knock out these secondary to-do items

        5 draws of effect sizes for trait mutations should actually come froma strictly positive distribution and then multiplied by a random -1 or +1 (and that distr
          should be able to have its draws fixed at mu when sigma == 0) ---> THEN UPDATE THE DOCS!

        5 not at all sure that a gamma is the right distribution for drawing the deleterious mutations' effects

        5 replace all "if str(type(whatever))" statements with proper "isinstance(whatever, classname)" calls as soon as I know how my finalized class names are going to
          look to geonomics when it's properly set up as a package
        
        5 I say that a Layer can have any number of change events, but the make_parameters_file only takes a bool argument for 'change', not an integer; decide and make
          this consistent
                - the 'end_rast' parameter also should be able to take a filepath, not just a numpy array (which seems almost useless)

        3 write a Land.plot_land_changes method (akin to Population.plot_demographic_changes)??

        5 write `Model.plot` methods to wrap around all the pop and land plotting methods (where they just take a required first arg, either the pop number or name or the scape number or name

        5 pick through all the notes in demography.py and decide which are taken care of, which need to stay, which I still need to take care of, etc. 

        5 for draft docs:
          - write docstrings for remaining key classes
          - make some simple flow diagram/schematic
          - add images
          - explain dist-parameters' name format somewhere

        5 decide what to do if someone instantiates a model that has no neutral loci (line 126 in genome.py currently throws an error)

        5 use Wright's genetic neighborhood/cruising distance to set window width of DensityGrids
                BUT: I can't exactly do this without working out the following issues:
                1. - If I try to use a window width that isn't a whole-number factor of the landscape
                     dimensions then I get weird errors in the calculated density surface (I have
                     images of this saved under 10-09-18 in the images directory on my Desktop)
                2. - The runtime get ridiculous at small window widths for large landscapes and large
                     numbers of individuals (see runtime plots, also in the same directory as above)

        5 decide whether or not to enable non-moving populations! (right now it's offered in the params, but then doesn't work)
                IF SO, PROBABLY NEED TO CREATE A DISPERSAL SURFACE JUST LIKE THE MOVEMENT SURFACE

        5 add type annotation to all functions

        5 write lots of checks on the types of all the data in the params file, with informative errors

        2 finalize nice string representations for all classes

        2 generalize the change fns some more, so that landscape changes can also be made cyclical, random, etc (like pop-dem changes)

        1 write a function for plotting the community (where each pop has a different color) (how about some way for each population to have its fitness
          plotted with colors as usual, but SHAPE to be population indicator?)

        1 perhaps read through and consider rewriting mating.find_mates() (i.e. consider how to re-implement repro_age and sex to speed it up)

        5 debug all the various ways that pop extinction breaks the model; here is one example, that results from one of multiple populations going extinct
