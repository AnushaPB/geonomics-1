- knock out these secondary to-do items:
        - make osgeo into an optional dependency somehow
        - finalize nice string representations for all classes
        - make Scape and Population names their params keys, rather than the 'name' dict entry inside them
        - change Population back from a class that inherits from an OrderedDict to one that inherits from a plain old dict (since dicts are now ordered, as of Py 3.6 [reliable starting Py 3.7])
        - decide whether to keep heterozygosit effects, and if so, update
        - use Wright's genetic neighborhood/cruising distance to set window width of DensityGrids
        - add sex ratio as an extra parameter
        - remove 'ERROR' from all my assert/raise error strings
        - fix the FIXME note in sim.model.reset() fn
        - add an 'nlmpy'-type scape (its params section, and a function to wrap around nlmpy key function(s))
        - decide whether or not to enable non-moving populations! (right now it's offered in the params, but then doesn't work)
        - add type annotation to all functions
        - write lots of checks on the types of all the data in the params file, with informative errors
        - generalize the change fns some more, so that landscape changes can also be made cyclical, random, etc (like pop-dem changes)
        - standardize dist-parameter names across the whole pkg; perhaps the convention should be <param_name><dist_name>_dist? e.g. mean_distance_dist?

- systematically debug all 'plot' functions

- walk through & methodically clean up all code and comments, line by line

- integrate unit tests into master branch

- write popgen-based theoretical validations-tests

- add docstrings to all functions (look up current standards first)

- pull docstrings into a single LaTeX file, then add title, intro, TOC, and general info sections, and figures, to create V0.0 of the docs

- add an ./ex directory, which will contain a Yosemite simulation

- finalize pkg structure

- prep for PyPi release

- prep for Oct 22 lab meeting

- script and run sims for the first study

- put together analyses and manuscript

- send out for publication
