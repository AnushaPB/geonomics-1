- knock out these secondary to-do items:

        6 decide whether or not to add a switch determining whether movement surafces are calculated up front, before model is run, or are calculated during the model run (b/c of the memory/compute time ttrade-off)

        5 ASK IAN: draws of effect sizes for trait mutations should actually come froma strictly positive distribution and then multiplied by a random -1 or +1 (and that distr
          should be able to have its draws fixed at mu when sigma == 0) ---> THEN UPDATE THE DOCS!

        5 not at all sure that a gamma is the right distribution for drawing the deleterious mutations' effects

        5 consider adding a generalized function for making a distribution's draw be a function of phenotype, then apply that to movement, dispersal, fecundity, etc?

        5 consider adding ability for life-history parameters to be determined by a trait's phenotype

        5 DOCS:
          - make clearer that "dispersal" means "offspring" and is differentiated from "movement"
          - make clear that a Species' K will change because of landscape changes in the Layer it's based on, or because of parameterized changes, OR BOTH (BUT BOTH WILL BE A MESS,
            so user should either include a Layer in the Landscape that won't change, just to start off a Pop's K raster, then tweak that K raster with demo changes, OR plan Landscape
            changes knowing that the Species' K raster will be affected, but NOT BOTH!)
          - write docstrings for remaining classes
          - add images
          - explain dist-parameters' name format somewhere
          - put together some examples (from simplest upward), in a Cookbook section of the docs
                - and use one of them as an off-the-bat example that can serve as a vehicle for continuing to discuss all the additional possible parts of a model?
          - add to the Intro (or somewhere near there) in the docs a list of the sorts of questions the package could answer???
          - rework Intro based on feedback from lab meeting, and on Nick's notes (see his email)
          - add mention of "geonomics" the philosophical movememnt (and disambiguation)
          - add a graphical representation of the model components to the docs (Species composed of Individuals, optionally having genomes, optionally subtending phenotypes, and living on a Landscape with multiple Layers)

        5 touch up all comments (only add necessary, non-obvious comments, and separate each comment-topped section by a single line break)

        5 add type annotation to all functions

        5 write lots of checks on the types of all the data in the params file, with informative errors

        2 finalize nice string representations for all classes

        5 replace all "if str(type(whatever))" statements with proper "isinstance(whatever, classname)" calls as soon as I know how my finalized class names are going to
          look to geonomics when it's properly set up as a package

- write popgen-based theoretical validations-tests

- add docstrings to all functions (look up current standards first)

- add an ./ex directory, which will contain a Yosemite simulation

- finalize pkg structure

- prep for PyPi release

- script and run sims for the first study
        - genomic conflict and adaptation to climate change (2 traits, 2 environmental gradients, 1 static, 1 dynamic)
        - LOOK INTO YOSEMITE CHIPMUNKS

- put together analyses and manuscript

- send out for publication
