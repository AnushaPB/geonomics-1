- knock out these secondary to-do items
        2 finalize nice string representations for all classes
        5 decide whether to keep heterozygosity effects, and if so, update
        5 use Wright's genetic neighborhood/cruising distance to set window width of DensityGrids
        5 decide whether or not to enable non-moving populations! (right now it's offered in the params, but then doesn't work)
        5 add type annotation to all functions
        5 write lots of checks on the types of all the data in the params file, with informative errors
        4 generalize the change fns some more, so that landscape changes can also be made cyclical, random, etc (like pop-dem changes)
        5 standardize dist-parameter names across the whole pkg; perhaps the convention should be <param_name><dist_name>_dist? e.g. mean_distance_dist?



- systematically debug all 'plot' functions

- walk through & methodically clean up all code and comments, line by line

- integrate unit tests into master branch

- write popgen-based theoretical validations-tests

- add docstrings to all functions (look up current standards first)

- pull docstrings into a single LaTeX file, then add title, intro, TOC, and general info sections, and figures, to create V0.0 of the docs

- add an ./ex directory, which will contain a Yosemite simulation

- finalize pkg structure

- prep for PyPi release

- prep for Oct 22 lab meeting

- script and run sims for the first study
        - genomic conflict and adaptation to climate change (2 traits, 2 environmental gradients, 1 static, 1 dynamic)
        - LOOK INTO YOSEMITE CHIPMUNKS

- put together analyses and manuscript

- send out for publication
