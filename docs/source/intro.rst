Introduction
############


A Python package for simulation of genomic evolution on complex landscapes.
Provides for easy construction of individual-based, spatially explicit,
forward-time simulation models under arbitrarily complex scenarios.

Provides easy construction of models with arbitrarily complex scenarios,
including spatially varying selection, selection on multiple, monogenic or
polygenic traits, and non-stationary demographic and environmental change.


Key Features
************

  1. An object-oriented scripting framework, allowing
  for easy model construction, customization, and extension
  2. Model set-up from a single, well annotated parameters file
  3. Tools for customizable collection of data throughout a simulation
  4. Ability to model complex evolutionary scenarios, including custom
  demographic change, spatially varying selection, and multiple polygenic
  traits 
  5. Ability to model complex spatial scenarios, including multi-layer
  simulated or real-world landscapes, resistance-based movement, and
  non-stationary environmental change
  6. Numerous visualization tools, to help the user design models and
  explore results
