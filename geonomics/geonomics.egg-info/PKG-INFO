        **Geonomics** allows users to build and run arbitrarily complex, forward-time,
        agent-based, and spatially explicit simulations for landscape genomics. It is
        designed to allow novice Python users to create sophisticated simulations with
        minimal code, while also allowing advanced users a high level of extensibility
        and customizability.
        
        We will continue to expand and add functionality in future versions. Please
        contact us with questions, suggestions, or requests!
        
        Main Features
        -------------
        The following is a short list of highlights. For the full monty, please see the
        `original methods paper <PAPER_URL_HERE>`_ and the `homepage <https://github.com/drewhart/geonomics>`_.
        
            - a model object, which serves as the primary user interface and which
              contains all other model components
            - a landscape object consisting of an arbitrary number of environmental
              raster layers
            - a community object consisting of an arbitrary number of species objects,
              each consisting of an arbitrary number of individuals
            - an optional genomic-architecture object, upon which individuals' genomes
              are based
            - spatialized logistic growth regulating local population densities
            - the capability to model realistic movement and offspring dispersal
              across conductance surfaces
            - neutral and non-neutral evolution capabilities, with spatially contingent
              selection
            - demographic- and environmental-change capabilities
            - the capability to run an arbitrary number of iterations of a model
            - the capability to sample data and a variety of statistics at any desired
              timesteps during a model run
            - numerous visualization methods to aid in model design, exploration,
              analysis, and presentation
        
        Quickstart
        ----------
        The impatient beginner can try the following::
        
          >>> import geonomics as gnx
          >>> mod = gnx.run_default_model()
        
        This will build and run **geonomics**' default model, return its `Model` object
        as `mod`, and leave its parameters file in your current working directory under
        the name 'GEONOMICS_default_model_params.py'.
        
        
        .. note::
        Disclaimer
        ----------
        **Geonomics** claims no affiliation with the philosophy and economic ideology
        `Georgism <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism>`_, sometimes referred to as
        'geonomics'. It is a portmanteau of **geo**\graphy and ge\ **nomics**.
        I just thought it sounded neat, and found it delightfully confusing.
